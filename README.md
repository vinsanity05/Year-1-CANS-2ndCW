# Year 1 CANS 2nd Coursework

This project is a randomly computed computer maze and was generated by a given seed which was my Student ID. The goal is to get the highest amount of points or score in this maze with the least number of moves made possible and levelling up your student bot to the highest it can be. This is achieved by reading and attending events.
